# life_simulator
**Life Simulator** is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using WinForms in C#
# Rules of the Game:
1. Survival: A living cell with 2 or 3 living neighbors survives to the next generation. Otherwise, it dies.
2. Birth: A dead cell with exactly 3 living neighbors becomes alive in the next generation.
3. Death: Cells outside the grid boundary are considered permanently dead.
# Features:
- Grid-based field where each cell can be either alive or dead.
- Dynamic evolution of the grid based on simple rules.
- Visual representation using PictureBox in WinForms.
- Timer-driven generation updates.
# Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Run the project to start the simulation.
# How to Play:
- Click the "Start" button to begin the simulation.
- Click the "Stop" button to pause the simulation.
- Watch as the patterns evolve over time according to the rules of the game.
